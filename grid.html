        <h1>A beginner’s guide to making Progressive Web Apps</h1>
        <p>
            You may have heard about Progressive Web Apps or PWAs for short, I’m not 
            going to go into all the details of what exactly makes up a PWA or how they 
            work. For the purpose of this post,<b> a PWA is a website that you can add to 
            your phone’s home screen</b> and that will work while offline.

            I know some HTML, CSS, JavaScript and how to use GitHub.
            I am still new to web development and don’t want to learn why and how 
            stuff works right now. I want an easy, basic way to make something that 
            works without going through pages and pages of documentation and 
            tutorials. <b>Hopefully, this post will be all you need to get started in 
            making your own PWA.</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            To make a PWA we need a website. This of course, assumes you can already 
            make a website that scales well on all types of screens and devices. Luckily 
            we don’t need to do that from scratch, we can use a template. I like the ones 
            from HTML5 UP and Start Bootstrap. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Pick and download a theme, replace all the content with your own in the 
            index.html. You can even change the colours if you’re feeling brave enough 
            to edit some CSS.
            <br>
            <br>
            For this project, I was making a landing page for Web Community Leads UK 
            and IE. You can find out more about that by reading Daniels blog post about 
            it, or by visiting the site I made <a href="https://webcommunityukie.github.io/">https://webcommunityukie.github.io/</a> 
            Making this website into a PWA doesn’t add much for most users as I’m not 
            expecting anyone to add it to their home screen, but it will still make the 
            experience better. I just wanted a small site to start with to get into making 
            PWAs myself.
            <br>
            <br>
            I wanted a really simple site, I liked Hacksmiths website and knew it was 
            opensource so I downloaded and gutted it. I did keep in a link at the bottom 
            of the site that refers back to them and the link to the code so people can 
            fork our new site.
            <br>
            <br>
            Now that we have a website we can start turning it into a progressive web 
            app. To do this we need to add a few things to it which I’ll go through as we 
            need them.
